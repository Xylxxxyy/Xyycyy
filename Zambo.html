        <h2>About Zamboanga City</h2>
        <p>Zamboanga City is a highly urbanized city located in Mindanao, Philippines. It is known for its rich cultural heritage, beautiful beaches, and vibrant festivals.</p>
        <h2>Attractions</h2>
        <ul>
            <strong>Paseo del Mar</strong>
             <img src="Paseo.jpeg"style:"height=260px width=200px">:
            <p>One of the most stunning parks in the country in Zamboanga City is Paseo Del Mar. One may see the most breathtaking sunsets in the city as well as a breathtaking view of Basilan Island and Santa Cruz here. From Paseo del Mar, one could also observe the city's active port.</p>

        <strong> Fort 
          Pilar </strong>
<img src="Pilar.jpeg"style:"height=260px width=200px">:           

            <p>Fort Pilar is a fortress built by the Spaniards in the early 17th century. The complete name of the fort is "Real Fuerza de Nuestra Senora del Pilar de Zaragoza" ("Royal Fortress of Our Lady of the Pillar of Zaragoza"), with a clear reference to one of the most venerated images of the Virgin Mary in Spain. According to local tradition, the Virgin Mary had appeared in the area at least twice, first in 1734 (I don't know for what reason) and once more in 1897 (to save the city from a tsunami).

Today the fort is an open landmark and a Marian shrine in Zamboanga City. Aside from the fort, you can also visit a small museum. You can visit not only the outside walls of the fort, but also its internal part with a well-maintained garden. For a brief background on the history of the place, just read a historical marker at the entrance to the museum.

The first time I visited this place, I was touched by the pilgrims' devotion to the Virgin Mary. Many would visit the fort to pay homage to the image of the Virgin Mary on one of the fort's walls. The hotel I was staying at that time ... the Lantaka Hotel ... was just a walking distance from the fort. It's one place rich in history .. worth-vising when you are in this "city of flowers" in Mindanao, Philippines.</p>


<strong> Merloquet
          Falls  </strong>
<img src="Falls.jpeg"style:"height=260px width=200px">:
            <p>Merloquet Falls is a stunning waterfall that flows down a rock formation and is surrounded by lush flora. The falls are about 68 kilometers east of Zamboanga City in Sibulao. The falls are accessible by a lovely drive through the countryside and a short trek through the forest.</p>

      <li>
            <strong>Sta. Cruz Island</strong><img src="ISLAND.jpeg" alt="Sta. Cruz Island" style="width:60%;max-width:200px;">
            <p>Great Santa Cruz Island is a small inhabited island in Zamboanga City in the southern region of the Philippines that is famous for its pink coralline sand. The island, located 4 kilometres south of downtown at the Santa Cruz Bank in the Basilan Strait, boasts one of the pink sand beaches in the Philippines</p>
